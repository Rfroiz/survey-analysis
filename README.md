## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow survey data from 2023 to better understand:


1. How old are the developers? What are your development stacks? In which country do they work? What is the employment model? What are the main programming languages?
2. How much is remote work related to the developer's age?
3. How much is remote work related to the developer stack?
4. How much does remote work relate to the country where you work?
5. In-person work pays more than remote work? We will see this relationship according to the countries that pay the most according to the work model. 




## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


in the datalake folder you have stackoverflow research files from different years.## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@froisrodolfo/is-remote-work-the-most-practiced-this-survey-made-for-developers-can-answer-you-dbbbef9a1cef).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
